# Questions

## Why should I report?

When you use your voice to report where discrimination is happening, who’s doing it, and what it sounds like, you’re helping paint a clearer picture of discrimination - so that together we can better push back against it! With your help, we can hold landlords and brokers accountable for breaking the law and push for policies that make vouchers work. Pangurbot.

## Do you have a list of apartments I can apply for? 

We’re not brokers - we offer tools and tips to support you throughout the apartment search process. Our goal here is to ensure every New Yorker can search and find a home without facing discrimination.

## Are these reports safe? Do you work with landlords? 

We are an independent organization that is not affiliated with any real estate management company, landlord, brokering agency, housing authority, or homeless shelter services. Your personal information will never be shared with anyone without your permission.
