**Elizabeth Byrd** is a mother of six and a founding member of Unlock's NYC Leadership Collective. Her experience as a housing voucher holder spans over 17 years. She has a passion for housing equity, having experienced housing insecurity alongside her children. As a result, she is now advocating for the rights of other mothers and children. Through her work with voucher holders and the organizations that support them, she is dedicated to building relationships in the community. As part of her most recent work, Elizabeth worked with the administration of Mayor Eric Adams. By invitation of the administration, New Yorkers with lived experience participated in roundtable discussions on housing. Tenants were encouraged to share their stories and provide input during the development of the housing blueprint titled, "Housing Our Neighbors: A Blueprint for Housing and Homelessness." In her spare time, she enjoys swimming, dancing, traveling, event planning, photography, watching movies, and listening to music.
