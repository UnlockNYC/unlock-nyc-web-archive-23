Velvet Johnson Ross is a dedicated activist, a well-established performer, a women's historian and a founding member of Unlock's NYC Leadership Collective. In addition to her work with Unlock, she is on the steering committee for Housing Justice for All and a member leader at Neighbors Together. Velvet became homeless after she was illegally evicted by her landlord who refused to remediate toxic black mold and several vermin infestations in her rent stabilized apartment. This wreaked havoc on her health and led to severe health complications that still resonate today. That’s why she’s fighting to stem the tide of the homelessnesses and evictions; to make sure no one else goes through what she went through. Dedicated to serving as a bridge between Unlock NYC and other partner organizations that share our mission, Velvet is an integral part of our community. In her capacity as an advocate for single women facing housing insecurity, she facilitates the connection between women and the organizations that can provide assistance. Among her favorite pastimes are enjoying fine wines, a night out on the town, dancing, lectures and book club meetings.
