Proud mother of three, **Jessica Valencia** is a Brooklyn born and bred mom. As Head of Communications at Unlock NYC, she cultivates relationships with voucher holders via online communities to inform them about their housing rights and the digital tools Unlock NYC offers. As part of her work, she collaborates with organizations and advocates that are committed to combating source of income discrimination. Her passions include implementing successful social media campaigns, leading demos and Hair Housing workshops, and facilitating the Leadership Collective, Unlock NYC's governing board. She originally discovered Unlock NYC when she found herself facing source of income discrimination while looking for a home for her family. She has made it her lifelong passion to ensure that New Yorkers have access to affordable and safe housing as a result of her housing journey. Among her goals, she is dedicated to scaling Unlock NYC's digital tools in an effort to ensure that New York City is an equitable place to live for all. The things she enjoys most in life include coffee, long walks by the ocean, messy paint sessions with her children, trying out new Thai restaurants in her neighborhood, and creating mood boards on Canva.
