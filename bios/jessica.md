**Jessica Valencia** is a Brooklyn born and bred mom. As Head of Communications at Unlock NYC, she ensures that every voucher holder and the organizations who support them know about their rights and the tools we offer through cultivating our online community, leading demos and workshops, and facilitating the Leadership Collective, our governing board. She originally discovered Unlock NYC when she found herself being a victim of source of income discrimination while looking for a home for her family. She has turned her housing journey into her lifelong passion, and now wants to help thousands of homeless New Yorkers find permanent housing. She brings her knack for connecting with fellow New Yorkers and her deep knowledge of the voucher system to the team. Besides being a mom to twins, she enjoys coffee runs and long walks around her neighborhood.
