<p>During your housing search, you’re protected from harassment or discrimination based on your COVID-19 status. That means a landlord can’t force you to take a COVID-19 diagnostic test. <strong>You can report that!</strong></p>

          <h1>&quot;I was flat-out told, 'we don't take vouchers here.'&quot;</h1>
<p>The vast majority of apartments in New York City are covered by either the NYC or the NYS Human Rights Law. These laws prohibit landlords from turning down prospective tenants simply because they have a voucher.</p>
<p>If you hear the phrase &quot;no vouchers,&quot; <strong>you can report that!</strong> You can take action every time a landlord denies you an apartment.</p>

          <h1>&quot;You don't meet the minimum income requirements.&quot;</h1>
<p>As long as you are looking for housing within your voucher price point, income requirements shouldn't apply to you. If you're told &quot;you need to make 40x the rent&quot; or &quot;vouchers don't count as income,&quot; <strong>report it!</strong></p>
<p>Has a broker recently used income requirements to deny you an apartment? You can report it <strong>using our tools!</strong></p>

<p>Brokers often pretend that a unit is off the market if they don't want to rent to you. Or, they'll show you a different unit in significantly worse conditions, or in a different neighborhood. This practice, called &quot;steering,&quot; is illegal, and <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>

          <h1>&quot;They said the landlord only takes Section 8, not CityFHEPS.&quot;</h1>
<p>Landlords can't pick and choose which vouchers or programs they accept. If they own more than 6 units, by New York City law, a landlord must accept all rental assistance programs. If a landlord tries to turn you down because of your voucher, <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>

          <h1>&quot;He said he'd check with the landlord and call me back. He never did.&quot;</h1>

          <h1>&quot;The broker said I needed to pay extra because of my voucher.&quot;</h1>
<p>Brokers can't ask you for extra money on the side. It's unprofessional – and illegal. If someone demands a bribe to view or hold an apartment, or proposes that you pay extra rent under the table, <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>
<p>Has a broker ever tried to extort you for more money? <strong>Report it!</strong></p>
