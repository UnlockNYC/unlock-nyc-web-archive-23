<p>Ever been denied an apartment because you don't have a 700 credit score? If your voucher covers 100% of your rent, landlords shouldn't be using your credit score against you. You can <strong>report that!</strong></p>

          <h1>&quot;I was flat-out told, 'we don't take vouchers here.'&quot;</h1>
<p>The vast majority of apartments in New York City are covered by either the NYC or the NYS Human Rights Law. These laws prohibit landlords from turning down prospective tenants simply because they have a voucher.</p>
<p>If you hear the phrase &quot;no vouchers,&quot; <strong>you can report that!</strong> You can take action every time a landlord denies you an apartment.</p>

          <h1>&quot;YOU DON'T MEET THE MINIMUM INCOME REQUIREMENTS.&quot;</h1>
<p>As long as you are looking for housing within your voucher price point, income requirements shouldn't apply to you. If you're told &quot;you need to make 40x the rent&quot; or &quot;vouchers don't count as income,&quot; <strong>report it!</strong></p>
<p>Has a broker recently used income requirements to deny you an apartment? You can report it <strong>using our tools!</strong></p>

          <h1>&quot;They said the unit was no longer available.&quot;</h1>
<p>Brokers often pretend that a unit is off the market if they don't want to rent to you. Or, they'll show you a different unit in significantly worse conditions, or in a different neighborhood. This practice, called &quot;steering,&quot; is illegal, and <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>
<p>Has this happened to you recently? That's not right - take action and <strong>report it now!</strong></p>

          <h1>&quot;They said the landlord only takes Section 8, not CityFHEPS.&quot;</h1>
<p>Landlords can't pick and choose which vouchers or programs they accept. If they own more than 6 units, by New York City law, a landlord must accept all rental assistance programs. If a landlord tries to turn you down because of your voucher, <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>

          <h1>&quot;Only professionals live here. You must be working.&quot;</h1>
<p>As long as your voucher amount covers the rent for the apartment you're interested in, a landlord can't require proof of employment. If a landlord only allows &quot;professionals&quot; in their building, <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>

          <h1>&quot;The broker stopped responding after I mentioned my voucher.&quot;</h1>
<p>Ghosting is a common discriminatory tactic that can be hard to recognize. If a broker stops responding to your texts, calls, or e-mails after you mention your voucher, or gives you the runaround, <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>

          <h1>&quot;He said he'd check with the landlord and call me back. He never did.&quot;</h1>
<p>Brokers often pretend they need to check whether the landlord accepts vouchers to get you off the phone, and then never call you back. If you experience this kind of behavior, <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>
<p>Housing discrimination is often hiding in plain sight. <strong>Learn the sneaky phrases</strong> brokers often use to discriminate.</p>

          <h1>&quot;The broker said I needed to pay extra because of my voucher.&quot;</h1>
<p>Brokers can't ask you for extra money on the side. It's unprofessional – and illegal. If someone demands a bribe to view or hold an apartment, or proposes that you pay extra rent under the table, <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>
<p>Has a broker ever tried to extort you for more money? <strong>Report it!</strong></p>

          <h1>&quot;He said I needed a negative COVID test to see the apartment.&quot;</h1>
<p>During your housing search, you’re protected from harassment or discrimination based on your COVID-19 status. That means a landlord can’t force you to take a COVID-19 diagnostic test. <strong>You can report that!</strong></p>
