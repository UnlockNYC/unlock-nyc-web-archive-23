          <h1>&quot;They said my income and credit score were too low.&quot;</h1>
<p>Ever been told &quot;You need to make 40x the rent and have a 700 credit score?&quot; If you have a voucher, income requirements typically don't apply to you, and landlords are often not allowed to ask for your credit score.</p>

          <h1>I was flat-out told, 'we don't take vouchers here.'&quot;</h1>
<p>The vast majority of apartments in New York City are covered by either the NYC or the NYS Human Rights Law. These laws prohibit landlords from turning down prospective tenants simply because they have a voucher.</p>
<p>If you hear the phrase &quot;no vouchers,&quot; <strong>you can report that!</strong> Take action every time a landlord denies you an apartment.</p>

          <h1>&quot;They said the unit was no longer available.&quot;</h1>
<p>Brokers often pretend that a unit is off the market if they don't want to rent to you. Or, they'll show you a different unit in significantly worse conditions, or in a different neighborhood. This practice, called &quot;steering,&quot; is illegal, and <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>
<p>Has this happened to you recently? That's not right - take action and <strong>report it now!</strong></p>

          <h1>&quot;'The landlord only takes Section 8, not CityFHEPS,' they said.&quot;</h1>
<p>Landlords can't pick and choose which vouchers or programs they accept. If they own more than 6 units, by New York City law, a landlord must accept all rental assistance programs. If a landlord tries to turn you down because of your voucher, <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>
<p>Your voucher is a valid source of income. Learn more about <strong>how the NYC Human Rights Law protects you</strong> as a voucher holder.</p>

          <h1>&quot;'Only professionals live here,' they said. You must be working.&quot;</h1>
<p>As long as your voucher amount covers the rent for the apartment you're interested in, a landlord can't require proof of employment. If a landlord only allows &quot;professionals&quot; in their building, <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>

          <h1>&quot;The broker stopped responding after I mentioned my voucher.&quot;</h1>
<p>Ghosting is a common discriminatory tactic that can be hard to recognize. If a broker stops responding to your texts, calls, or e-mails after you mention your voucher, or gives you the runaround, <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>

          <h1>&quot;He said he'd check with the landlord and call me back. He never did.&quot;</h1>
<p>Brokers often pretend they need to check whether the landlord accepts vouchers to get you off the phone, and then never call you back. If you experience this kind of behavior, <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>
<p>Housing discrimination is often hiding in plain sight. <strong>Learn the sneaky phrases</strong> brokers often use to discriminate.</p>

          <h1>&quot;The broker said I needed to pay extra because of my voucher.&quot;</h1>
<p>Brokers can't ask you for extra money on the side. It's unprofessional – and illegal. If someone demands a bribe to view or hold an apartment, or proposes that you pay extra rent under the table, <strong>you can report that!</strong></p>
<p>Has a broker ever tried to extort you for more money? <strong>Report it!</strong></p>
