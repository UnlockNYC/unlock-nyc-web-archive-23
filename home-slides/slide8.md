# "The broker said I needed to pay extra because of my voucher."

Brokers can't ask you for extra money on the side. It's unprofessional â€“ and illegal. If someone demands a bribe to view or hold an apartment, or proposes that you pay extra rent under the table, **you can report that!**

Has a broker ever tried to extort you for more money? **Report it!**
