# "They said the unit was no longer available."

Brokers often pretend that a unit is off the market if they don't want to rent to you. Or, they'll show you a different unit in significantly worse conditions, or in a different neighborhood. This practice, called "steering," is illegal, and **you can report that!**

Has this happened to you recently? That's not right - take action and **report it now!**
