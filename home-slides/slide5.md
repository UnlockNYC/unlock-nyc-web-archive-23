# "They said the landlord only takes Section 8, not CityFHEPS."

Landlords can't pick and choose which vouchers or programs they accept. If they own more than 6 units, by New York City law, a landlord must accept all rental assistance programs. If a landlord tries to turn you down because of your voucher, **you can report that!**

Your voucher is a valid source of income. Learn more about **how the NYC Human Rights Law protects you** as a voucher holder.
