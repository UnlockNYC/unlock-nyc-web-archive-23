# We are here to make the apartment search process transparent, fair, and free from discrimination for all New Yorkers.

Unlock NYC is a tech nonprofit majority-led by women who have experienced housing discrimination due to having rental assistance vouchers. Our [free mobile tools](https://weunlock.nyc/start) help New Yorkers record phone calls and create a paper trail when landlords illegally turn them away. We connect them to government agencies and other resources so they can exercise their rights and find housing. Our [data](https://weunlock.nyc/soi-report/) enables advocates, attorneys, and the city to understand trends, develop policies that protect tenants, and open doors for more New Yorkers.

## Our Core Team

We’re a small and dedicated team that deeply believes in every human’s right to housing and in recognizing the long histories of race, class, and gender-based oppression that have created the housing crisis we face today. We operate through consensus and have a deep commitment to horizontal, distributed decision-making. Collectively, we hold experiences in participatory design, software engineering, political and tenant organizing, and direct experiences of housing discrimination and navigating the housing voucher system.

## Our Supporters + Collaborators

At Unlock NYC, we know New York City’s housing crisis will not be solved through a single intervention; it will take a mass, people-powered movement to win transformative change. That’s why take our cues from New Yorkers directly impacted by homelessness and from member-led organizations that mobilize for power and transformative change towards the right to housing. We support the [**#HomelessCantStayHome**](https://www.homelesscantstayhome.org/) and [**VALUE in Housing**](https://www.stopsidnyc.com/) campaigns, and look forward to continuing to build with our partners, collaborators, and allies in the future.

We couldn’t do this work without the hundreds of New Yorkers who’ve shared their stories and insights with us through interviews, surveys, participatory design sessions, and more. We’re committed to continue to co-design our tools with New Yorkers and grassroots advocates to ensure that everything we build is useful, relevant, and responds to the priorities of people most affected by housing injustice in our city.

## Our History

Our founding team met through [Blue Ridge Labs](https://labs.robinhood.org/ "Blue Ridge Labs") @ [Robin Hood](https://www.robinhood.org/ "Robin Hood"), a social impact incubator that brings together technologists, designers, and communities to address challenges important to low-income New Yorkers. During our research, we heard stories from dozens of New Yorkers who were repeatedly and unlawfully denied access to a home, simply because they received government assistance to pay for rent. Whether they were staying in a family shelter, doubled-up with friends or relatives, or trying to leave a precarious living arrangement, they would call an apartment listing to schedule a viewing and hear the same thing again and again: “No programs,” “The landlord prefers a working professional,” or “We don’t take your type of voucher here."

These practices, officially called "source of income discrimination" and commonly known as "voucher discrimination," [have been illegal in NYC since 2008](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cchr/law/source-of-income.page "Source of Income Discrimination"), but still impact thousands of New Yorkers with housing assistance vouchers or subsidies, including CityFHEPS, FHEPS, Section 8, HASA, and more. Often hiding in plain sight, discrimination happens in a split second over the phone, and can be tough to recognize, let alone document. As a result, countless New Yorkers remain homeless or in unsafe housing situations for months, if not years, and those who discriminate routinely benefit from breaking the law.
