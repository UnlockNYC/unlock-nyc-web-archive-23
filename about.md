## Our Story

Our founding team met through [Blue Ridge Labs](https://labs.robinhood.org/ "Blue Ridge Labs") @ [Robin Hood](https://www.robinhood.org/ "Robin Hood"), a social impact incubator that brings together technologists, designers, and communities to address critical problems facing New Yorkers through new and untested solutions. During our research, we heard stories from dozens of homeless New Yorkers who were repeatedly and unlawfully denied access to a home. Again and again, they called an apartment listing to schedule a viewing, and were met with the same range of responses: “Sorry, the unit is no longer available,” “The landlord prefers a working professional,” or “We don’t take Section 8 here.” Often hiding in plain sight, discrimination happens in a split second over the phone, and can be tough to recognize, let alone document. As a result, countless New Yorkers remain homeless for months, if not years, and those who discriminate routinely profit from breaking the law.

## Our Approach

At Unlock NYC, we work with homeless and housing-insecure New Yorkers to build technology that makes it easy to identify, record, and report discrimination. Our users can choose to send their report to an enforcement agency that will take legal action on their behalf, or to add their story to our growing body of data on housing discrimination in New York City. Armed with this knowledge, we collaborate with advocates, organizers, and public agencies to hold discriminators accountable and push for stronger fair housing policies. Our vision is a New York City where everyone can find a safe, healthy, and secure place to call home.

## Our Day-to-Day Team

We’re a small and dedicated team that deeply believes in every human’s right to housing and in recognizing the long histories of race, class, and gender-based oppression that have created the housing crisis we face today. We operate through consensus and have a deep commitment to horizontal, distributed decision-making. Collectively, we hold experiences in participatory design, software engineering, political and tenant organizing, and direct experiences of homelessness and navigating the housing voucher system.

## Our Leadership Collective

At Unlock NYC, we value lived experience as expertise. Our tools are at their best when the people who use them are involved in big decisions from the start. As close collaborators and advisors to the Unlock NYC team, Leadership Collective members help shape the direction of our organization, and make sure that the knowledge, ideas, and vision of New Yorkers directly impacted by homelessness and housing insecurity are at the heart of our work. Each Leadership Collective member brings a unique perspective and a set of skills to help inform strategic decisions.

## Our Unlock NYC Community

We couldn’t do this work without the many New Yorkers who’ve shared their stories and insights with us through interviews, surveys, participatory design sessions, and more. We’re committed to continue to co-design our tools with homeless New Yorkers and grassroots advocates to ensure that everything we build is useful, relevant, and responds to the priorities of people most affected by housing injustice in our city.
