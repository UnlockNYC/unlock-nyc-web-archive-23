Going by the moniker **Fannie Lou Diane** in the spirit of freedom fighter Fannie Lou Hamer and the groundbreaking and trailblazing Diana Ross. She wants to follow in their footsteps of fighting for the rights of women and especially that of women of color who are disengaged, disenfranchised, and disempowered while looking like Mahogany.
