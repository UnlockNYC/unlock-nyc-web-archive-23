Going by the moniker **Fannielou Diane** in the spirit of freedom fighter Fannie Lou Hamer and the groundbreaking and trailblazing Diana Ross. She wants to follow in the footsteps of fighting for the rights of women and especially that of women of color who are disengaged, disenfranchised and is empowered while looking like Mahogany.
