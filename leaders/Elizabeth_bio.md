Single divorcee and mom of six, and grandmother of four, **Elizabeth** has years of experience being on different boards, leadership teams for parents, social committees, or just being on a panel to talk about an important subject she has tons of experience or knowledge about. As an Unlock NYC Leadership Collective member, Elizabeth trains organizations and volunteers about what it's like to navigate the housing search with a voucher and how to be an effective advocate for yourself and others. This builds on one of her many strengths as someone who is always an advocate for her kids, and whatever situation comes her way. If she doesn’t know the answer, she can get help finding it. Her motto: “Ask questions, ask for help, it's out there. But if you don’t ask, you’ll never know.”
