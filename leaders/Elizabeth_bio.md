Single divorcee and mom of six, grandmother of three, and one on the way. **Elizabeth** has years of experience being on different boards, leadership teams for parents, social committees, or just being on a panel to talk about an important subject she has tons of experience or knowledge about. Always an advocate for her kids, and whatever situation comes her way. If she doesn’t know the answer, she can get help finding it. Her motto: “Ask Questions, Ask for Help, it's out there. But if you don’t ask you’ll never know.”
