# User Agreement

## Introduction

Welcome to Unlock NYC! We build free and inclusive technology that makes the apartment search process transparent and fair. Our website and tools are free to use, but we ask that you read and agree to this User Agreement before using them. In this document, we describe your rights and our rights relating to the services we provide – and our responsibilities to each other as we build this community.

Please read this User Agreement (including our [Privacy Policy](/privacy)) in full before using our website or our tools, and make sure you agree. If you have additional questions or feedback, you can email us at [hello@weunlock.nyc](mailto:hello@weunlock.nyc)

Specifically, we want you to feel comfortable with the following terms before you decide to use our website, tools, or other services:

1. You understand that Unlock NYC does not provide legal advice.
2. You agree not to submit content that is abusive, defamatory, or otherwise unlawful.
3. You understand that we cannot guarantee the accuracy of information shared by users.
4. You have read our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) in full.
5. You understand that our links to third-party sites or services does not imply endorsement.
6. You know that we may make changes to this user agreement as we learn and grow, so you’ll periodically review this document to make sure you still agree.

## Legal advice

Unlock NYC is not a law firm, or a substitute for an attorney or law firm – if you need legal advice, please contact a lawyer qualified to give advice on legal issues pertaining to housing. While our goal is to keep any information we provide accurate and up-to-date, the law changes rapidly and may be subject to different interpretation by different courts, so we can’t guarantee that this information is accurate and up-to-date, and also can’t guarantee it applies to your situation. That’s why Unlock NYC does not provide any form of legal advice, and absolutely no communication between you and Unlock NYC (including but not limited to: our website, chatbot, social media pages, or direct communication with our team) should be considered legal advice.

## User-contributed content

Unlock NYC’s website, tools, and social media contain opportunities for users to contribute content. These include but are not limited to online communities (such as our Facebook page) and reporting chatbot.

You agree that when using one of these communication services, you will not: defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights (such as privacy and publicity) of others; publish, post, upload, distribute, or disseminate any inappropriate, profane, defamatory, infringing, obscene, or unlawful content; upload files that contain viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or programs that may damage the operation of another’s computer, or violate any applicable laws or regulations.

## Accuracy of user-contributed content

Unlock NYC reviews contributions, such as reports, made on the site and removes inappropriate content regularly. We have no obligation to monitor communication services, but we reserve the right to review materials and remove any materials at our sole discretion. Our group is not responsible, however, for data sent by our users. We do not provide any guarantees about the information provided on the site.

## Privacy

Unlock NYC makes your privacy a priority, and your use of Unlock NYC is subject to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy). Please read this [Privacy Policy](/privacy) in full, which governs our site, tools, and social media accounts and informs users about our data collection practices.

## Links to third-party sites/services

Unlock NYC may contain links to other sites. While we make our best effort to provide links that we have had positive experiences with and whose information we trust, we do not control or necessarily endorse the third party sites and third party services we link to, and Unlock NYC is not responsible for their contents, accuracy, or security.

## Modifications

From time to time, as we learn, grow, and expand our range of services, Unlock NYC may modify our User Agreement and/or Privacy Policy. We always aim to do so in careful alignment with our values as an organization and with input from our user community. If we make modifications, they will be effective immediately upon our posting of the modifications on the Unlock NYC website. We are not obligated to notify users about every update, but we will make an effort to highlight what has changed, for instance as an announcement on our home page, or on the User Agreement or Privacy Policy pages themselves.
