questions: '<h1>Questions</h1><h2>What does Unlock NYC do?</h2><p>Unlock NYC works
  with voucher holders and advocates to build tools that make it easier to identify,
  document, and report “source of income” discrimination on your housing search. If
  you live in New York City and you have a voucher (such as CityFHEPS, Section 8,
  FHEPS, or HASA), you can use our website to tell us about unfair treatment by a
  broker, management company, or landlord. We can add your report to our advocacy
  database, and we can also connect you to an organization or government agency who
  can tell you about your rights and your options to address that specific incident.</p><p>We
  also know that the housing search with a voucher can often be frustrating, discouraging,
  and lonely, so we offer <a href="https://bit.ly/weunlocknycworkshop" title="workshops">workshops</a>,
  1-on-1 peer support calls, and other <a href="https://linktr.ee/weunlocknyc" title="resources">resources</a>
  where you can build community and exchange experiences and tips with other voucher
  holders.</p><h2>Why should I report?</h2><p>There are many reasons you might want
  to report unfair treatment on your housing search, and justice looks different to
  everyone. For example, some people are interested in learning about their rights
  and whether they can file a formal complaint. Other people want a chance at applying
  to an apartment they were turned down from. And others just want to share their
  story so that the broker or landlord gets on the radar of organizations working
  in housing justice.</p><p>When you use your voice to report where discrimination
  is happening, who’s doing it, and what it sounds like, you’re helping paint a clearer
  picture of discrimination – so that together we can better push back against it!
  With your help, we can hold landlords and brokers accountable and also advocate
  for policies that make vouchers work.</p><h2>What does Unlock NYC do with my report?</h2><p>Unlock
  NYC will add anonymized details about the incident you share with us to our crowdsourced
  database of where voucher holders are experiencing unfair treatment, who’s doing
  it, and what tactics they’re using. We work with advocacy partners like the VALUE
  in Housing Campaign to shine a light on how voucher discrimination is impacting
  New Yorkers and what needs to change (for an example, check out our recent report
  <a href="https://weunlock.nyc/soi-report/" title="SOI report">here</a>)</p><p>If
  you want individual help with your specific situation, you can also request that
  we send a copy of your report to organizations who provide counseling on your rights
  and may be able to connect you to legal services if needed. In 2021, we connected
  our users to the NYC Commission on Human Rights when they requested it. In 2022,
  we are working on adding more options to our tool.</p><p>You also don’t have to
  use Unlock NYC to report! If you prefer, you can report directly to agencies and
  organizations such as the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cchr/law/source-of-income.page"
  title="NYCCHR">NYC Commission on Human Rights</a>, the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hra/help/income-discrimination.page"
  title="HRA DSS SOI Unit">HRA/DSS Source of Income Unit</a>, the <a href="https://www.fairhousingjustice.org/our-work/housing-discrimination-complaints/"
  title="FHJC">Fair Housing Justice Center</a>, the <a href="https://dhr.ny.gov/complaint#file"
  title="NYS DHR">New York State Division of Human Rights</a>, or the <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/source-income-discrimination"
  title="NYS AG">New York State Attorney General''s Office</a>.</p><h2>Do you have
  a list of apartments I can apply for?</h2><p>No, we’re not brokers! But, we do offer
  tools, tips, and solidarity to support you throughout the apartment search process.
  Many of our team members and volunteers have been through the housing search process
  with a voucher in NYC, and can speak about what worked for them. Everyone’s situation
  is different, and we speak from our own experiences in the spirit of community-building
  and mutual aid.</p><h2>How do you keep my reports and information secure?</h2><p>We
  are an independent group that is not affiliated with any real estate management
  company, landlord, brokering agency, housing authority, or shelter services. You
  can choose to report anonymously, and we will never share your personal information
  without your permission. We encourage you to read our <a href="https://weunlock.nyc/privacy/">Privacy
  Policy</a> and let us know if you have any questions.</p><h2>I need to talk to an
  attorney. Can you help?</h2><p>Our team does not have any lawyers on staff and we
  cannot provide legal advice or representation. However, if you ask us to, we can
  connect you with an organization who can talk to you about your rights and options
  under the law and may be able to connect you with legal services. The Met Council
  on Housing also has a guide to finding a lawyer for housing-related issues <a href="https://www.metcouncilonhousing.org/help-answers/finding-a-lawyer/">here</a>,
  which you may find helpful.</p><h2>What other resources exist for voucher holders
  in NYC?</h2><p>Unlock NYC is working on just one specific piece of a big challenge:
  ensuring that every New Yorker with a voucher has a fair, efficient, and respectful
  housing search. There are organizations all over the city who have been doing amazing
  work to support voucher holders for much longer than we have, and we want to make
  sure you know about them! We are building an online learning center for voucher
  holders that will launch in 2022, but in the meantime we made <a href="https://linktr.ee/weunlocknyc">this
  list of resources</a> you might find helpful.</p>'

# It should be easier to find a home with your voucher.

**If you’ve been having a hard time finding a home with a voucher in New York City, it’s not your fault.** Vouchers are supposed to help tenants find a home in cities with limited affordable housing options. The vast majority of landlords in NYC are [required by law](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cchr/law/source-of-income.page#:\~:text=Discrimination%20based%20on%20lawful%20source%20of%20income%20is%20the%20illegal,other%20forms%20of%20public%20assistance.) to accept vouchers. And yet, landlords and brokers are turning down New Yorkers like you, every day.

You deserve to be treated fairly during your search for housing, no matter your situation. Whether you’ve been living in a family shelter, staying with friends or relatives, or you’re looking to move from your current place, you have the right to a fair housing search. We’re making it easier by offering free and friendly tools you can use to record and report discrimination.
