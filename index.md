questions: <h1>Questions</h1><h2>What does Unlock NYC do?</h2><p>Unlock NYC works
  with voucher holders and advocates to build tools that make it easier to identify,
  document, and report “source of income” discrimination on your housing search. If
  you live in New York City and you have a voucher (such as CityFHEPS, Section 8,
  FHEPS, or HASA), you can use our website to tell us about unfair treatment by a
  broker, management company, or landlord. We can add your report to our database,
  and we can also connect you to an organization or government agency who can tell
  you about your rights and your options to address that specific incident.</p><p>We
  also know that the housing search with a voucher can often be frustrating, discouraging,
  and lonely, so we offer <a href="https://bit.ly/weunlocknycworkshop" title="workshops">workshops</a>,
  1-on-1 peer support calls, and other <a href="https://linktr.ee/weunlocknyc" title="resources">resources</a>
  where you can build community and exchange experiences and tips with other voucher
  holders.</p><h2>Why should I report?</h2><p>When you use your voice to report where
  discrimination is happening, who’s doing it, and what it sounds like, you’re helping
  paint a clearer picture of discrimination – so that together we can better push
  back against it! With your help, we can hold landlords and brokers accountable for
  breaking the law and push for policies that make vouchers work.</p><h2>Do you have
  a list of apartments I can apply for?</h2><p>We’re not brokers! We offer tools and
  tips to support you throughout the apartment search process. Our goal here is to
  ensure every New Yorker can search for and find a home without facing discrimination
  due to their voucher.</p><h2>How do you keep my reports and information secure?</h2><p>We
  are an independent group that is not affiliated with any real estate management
  company, landlord, brokering agency, housing authority, or homeless shelter services.
  You can choose to report anonymously, and we will never share your personal information

# It should be easier to find a home with your voucher.

**If you’ve been having a hard time finding a home with a voucher in New York City, it’s not your fault.** Vouchers are supposed to help tenants find a home in cities with limited affordable housing options. The vast majority of landlords in NYC are [required by law](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cchr/law/source-of-income.page#:\~:text=Discrimination%20based%20on%20lawful%20source%20of%20income%20is%20the%20illegal,other%20forms%20of%20public%20assistance.) to accept vouchers. And yet, landlords and brokers are turning down New Yorkers like you, every day.

You deserve to be treated equally during your search for housing, no matter your situation. Whether you’ve been living in a family shelter, staying with friends or relatives, or you’re looking to move from your current place, you have the right to a fair housing search. We’re making it easier by offering free and friendly tools you can use to record and report discrimination.
